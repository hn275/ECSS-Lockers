The package-lock.json and package.json both had PlanetScale-related modules as part of the dependancies,
I replaced them with what I think is needed, we'll see.

In package-lock.json
Removed:
    "kysely-planetscale": "^1.3.0",
    "@planetscale/database": "^1.6.0",

    "node_modules/@planetscale/database": {
      "version": "1.7.0",
      "resolved": "https://registry.npmjs.org/@planetscale/database/-/database-1.7.0.tgz",
      "integrity": "sha512-lWR6biXChUyQnxsT4RT1CIeR3ZJvwTQXiQ+158MnY3VjLwjHEGakDzdH9kwUGPk6CHvu6UeqRXp1DgUOVHJFTw==",
      "engines": {
        "node": ">=16"
      }
    },
Added:
    "@libsql/client": "^0.6.0",

    "node_modules/@libsql/client":{
      "version": "0.6.0"
      [may need more stuff here I just don't know what yet]
    },
There's still the kysely-planetscale one sitting in there, and maybe another @planetscale/database,
but they should be able to just sit there for now.

In package.json
Added: "@libsql/client": "0.6.0",
to dependancies.

Trying to build the docker image comes up with an error about installing modules, so I need to come back to this.
