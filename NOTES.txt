The package.json both had PlanetScale-related modules as part of the dependancies,
I left them but added the libsql that I think we need, we'll see.

In package.json
Added: "@libsql/client": "0.6.0",
to dependancies.

Trying to build the docker image comes up with an error about installing modules, so I need to come back to this.
