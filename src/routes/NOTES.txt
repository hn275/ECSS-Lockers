In (app):
    Nothing in flash, 
    In /lockers, /login, /magic and in general,
    anything called +page.server.ts makes some references to db, but hopefully doesn't need changes.
In admin:
    Same idea, anything called +page.server.ts or just +server.ts references db.
Changed "ESS" to "ECSS" in +error.svelte.
